This repo contains the annotated dataset and code to replicate experiments and ablation studies from ACL 2022 long paper <a href="https://rajkumar-pujari.com/reinforcement_guided.html">Reinforcement Learning Guided Multi-Task Learning for Stereotype Detection</a> by Rajkumar Pujari, Erik Oveson, Priyanka Kulkarni and Elnaz Nouri.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
Fine-grained steretype detection dataset that was decribed in the paper is in the annotated_data.csv file. Each data point was annotated by three MTurk annotaters with two labels: 1) whether the text contains explicit and intentional stereotype and 2) whether the text contains implicit stereotypical association. Majority vote from the three annotaters was assigned as the data label.
